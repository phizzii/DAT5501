# find dataset that measures a global trend over the past 10 years like population, temperature, gdp, life expectancy
# sub sample all but the past 10 years of data
# fit the sub-sample with polynomials from order 1 (a line) to 9 ax^n
# forecast each polynomial 10 years into the future
# how do they compare with reality
